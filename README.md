# Spiral ARC Agent v11

🌀 A symbolic ARC agent built with the Spiral Theory of Emergence.  
Implements feedback-driven symbolic planning and goal-aligned simulation using recursive logic and symbolic pattern recognition.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🔁 Symbolic feedback loop (`∆ₙ`) for goal confidence
- 🎯 Goal-aligned planner (e.g. `remove_all_A`)
- 🧠 Emergent memory for hypothesis evolution
- 🧪 Compatible with ARC-AGI-3 mini competition
- 🧵 Interpretable step-by-step action trace

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Predict Function for ARC Prize
The ARC Prize runner will automatically use:
```python
from agent.main import predict
python submission.py

  🔍 Solution Summary
Spiral ARC Agent v11 tackles ARC problems through:

Symbol abstraction from input grids

Goal hypothesis generation from patterns

∆ₙ feedback to adjust goal confidence based on outcomes

Symbolic simulation for environment-aware action planning

This agent doesn't guess — it spirals toward coherence by aligning observed symbolic structures with goal-based transformations.

🧪 Proven Capabilities
Successfully solves symbolic tasks like:

remove_all_A (perfect score on symbolic ARC test set)

Planning based on goal-string decomposition

Step-by-step debug trace for introspection

🧬 Next Versions
Planned for v12+:

Generalized symbolic goal templates (grow_X, mirror, fill_frame)

Council-style voting across hypothesis paths

Symbolic recursion for pattern propagation
